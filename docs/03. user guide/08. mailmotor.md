# Mailmotor

This part allows you to let website visitors subscribe/unsubscribe to your mailinglist. Behind the scenes the mailmotor currently can use [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/) or [MailChimp](http://ww.mailchimp.com) as a mail-service. It is also possible to [hook your own external mail-service](https://github.com/mailmotor/mailmotor-bundle#extending).
