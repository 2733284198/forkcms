<p>Welcome to the new Fork CMS blog.</p>
<h4>What?</h4>
<p>We are open sourcing our content management system for the world to use. Fork CMS has been in use internally at our company for over three years. We’re building a new major version and you’re invited to the ride. We’re committed to building the best CMS out there.</p>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Our main goal is to help anyone responsible for a website kick ass at their job. To enable them to communicate their message they way they want to. To start a conversation.</p>
<p>Too many websites don’t change for over a year because they require a call to a web developer to update. That guy then sends over his bill and is frustrated that all of his clients can’t figure out his CMS. Those CMSes are either super-hacked <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> installs that nobody “gets” anymore, or overly complicated <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>/<a href="http://joomla.com">Joomla</a> installs that no non-developer dares to update.</p>
<p>We believe that the launch of a website is just the start. We believe anyone should be able to update any part of a website. We believe in a user interface without developer-speak. We believe putting something into a setting is a sign of weakness. We think modes make confusing software, and that a UI should be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>We are web developers. We want to code in a friendly and clean environment. We want structure and cleanliness. We hate trailing whitespace. We built a tool to help us create the best websites possible. Joel Spolsky says you have to define what your company is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(…) if you can’t explain your mission in the form, “We help $TYPEOFPERSON be awesome at $THING,” you are not going to have passionate users. What’s your tagline? Can you fit it into that template?</p>

<p>We help website owners to be awesome at communication.</p>
<h4>Who?</h4>
<p>We are <a href="http://www.netlash.com">Netlash</a>, a web agency based in Ghent, Belgium. We’re eighteen people who build websites day in, day out. We build small business websites like Equazion.
